== Welcome to GemBrowser

GemBrowser is an approach to visualize the Rubyverse (or better
Gemiverse). It visualizes the dependencies between gems and the
assoziations between auhtors and gems.

GemBrowser is based on Ruby On Rails.

This version of GemBrowser ships with a long outdated minimal database.

To update your database fetch gem metadata as yaml

  $ curl -o gems.yaml http://gems.rubyforge.org/yaml

And run the following script to import tha data

  $ script/runner lib/load_gems_data.rb

Have fun!
